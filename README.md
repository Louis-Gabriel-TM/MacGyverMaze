# MacGyver Maze

This repository contains the Python scripts and additional files of my __3rd project__ for the __*Python Developer Path* in [*OpenClassrooms*](https://openclassrooms.com/paths/developpeur-se-dapplication-python)__.

This *Object-Oriented Programming* project uses the *Pygame* package, observes PEP 8 and PEP 257 conventions and was developped in a virtual environnement (see requirements.txt).

## The game

The *MacGyver Maze* is a basic 2D labyrinth game.

MacGyver must __*collect 3 items*__ (a needle, a plastic tube and a flask of ether) in the labyrinth to make an anesthetic syringe. With this syringe, he will be able __*to neutralize is nemesis, Murdoc*__, who guards the exit. Then, MacGyver will escape this maze and continue to new adventures... :-p
