# MacGyverMaze
This repository contains the Python scripts and additional files of my 3rd project for the Python Developer Path of Open Classrooms.

The MacGyver Maze is a very simple 2D labyrinth game. MacGyver must collect 3 items (a needle, a plastic tube and a flask of ether) in the labyrinth to make an anesthetic syringe. With this syringe, he will be able to neutralize is nemesis, Murdoc, who guards the exit. So, MacGyver will escape this maze and be able to continue to new adventures... :-p
